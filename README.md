# Aviation Accident Analysis

Insurance Risk Assessment

Overview

This project evaluates commercial and passenger jet airline safety based on historical aviation accident data (1948-2023). The goal is to identify aircraft makes and models that exhibit low destruction rates and minimal passenger injuries in the event of an accident. The analysis is tailored for an airline/airplane insurer assessing risk factors for coverage decisions.

Key Findings

1. Aircraft Models with Strong Safety Records

Filtering models from 1983 onward (40-year retirement threshold), the following aircraft exhibited low destruction rates and low fatality likelihood in accidents:

Small Aircraft: Cessna 208 Caravan, Piper PA-46 Malibu, Beechcraft King Air B200.

Large Passenger Jets: Boeing 777, Airbus A320, Embraer E190.

These models demonstrated high survivability rates due to strong structural integrity, effective emergency protocols, and redundant safety systems.

2. Factors Influencing Safety Outcomes

3. Weather Conditions

Clear Weather: Significantly lower fatality rates.

Severe Storms: Increased likelihood of total destruction.

Icing Conditions: Higher chances of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) incidents.

Engine Type & Count
Twin-engine commercial jets: Show lower destruction rates vs. single-engine aircraft.

Turbo-prop aircraft: Exhibit a higher survival rate compared to older piston-engine models.

3. Statistical Insights

Destruction Rate Distribution

Models with high total destruction rates clustered around older aircraft (>30 years in service).

Newer models incorporate improved avionics and crash-resistant designs.

Injury Likelihood Across Aircraft Types

Boxplot Analysis showed larger commercial aircraft tend to have lower serious injury rates due to advanced cabin safety measures.
